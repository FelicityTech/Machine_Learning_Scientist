Observation:
Range: Increases significantly with the outlier since it only depends on the maximum and minimum values.
IQR: May increase slightly but isd robusts to outliers since it focused on the middle 50% of the data.
Variance and Standard Deviation: These increase drastically with the outlier, showing the sensitivity of these measures to extreme values.

Summary:
1. Range and Standard Deviation are sensitive to outliers.
2. IQR is more resistant to outliers and is a better measure of spread for skewed data.
3. Variance gives insight into how spread out the data is but can be influenced by extreme values.
